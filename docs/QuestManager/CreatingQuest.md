# Creating Quest

## _1. Opening EasyQuest Editor_

First, make sure you've created the EasyQuestManager object as mentioned in the setup phase.

To open the EasyQuest Manager window, you can either:    
A. Go to "Tools/EasyQuest/EasyQuest Edtior"    
B. On the gameobject with the "EasyQuestManager" script, press **Open Quest Editor Window**    

Once it's open, to create a quest you just have to press the "Add Quest" button.
Now the window should look like this.

For an explanation of this window, refer to [Easy Quest Editor Reference](EasyQuestEditorReference.md).      
    
    
Now that you've created quest, the next thing is [Handling the Quest](HandlingQuest.md).
